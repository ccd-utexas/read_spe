**Warning:** Never delete "develop" or "master" branches.

## Setup your GitHub account
- Create a github account.
- Have an existing ccd-utexas member add you to the organization. See the stache entry on the ccd-utexas GitHub organization for details.
- Install the github application: e.g. https://mac.github.com/
- Sign in with your github credentials
- Under "Repositories", open the "ccd-utexas" account.
- By "ccd-utexas/tsphot" click "Clone to Computer"
- Click the arrow to open the repository.

## Create your branch from "develop" and edit
- Make the "develop" branch active by double clicking.
- Click "+" to create your new branch off of "develop". Describe your miniproject in your branch name, then click "Branch".
- Click "Publish" to let others group members know of your project.
- Navigate to your local version of the cloned repository and make your code changes. To find the local cloned repository: Under "Repositories", right-click "ccd-utexas/tsphot", click "Show in Finder".
- Commit your changes to your branch often in case you need to revert back. To commit changes: Click "Changes", type a summary and description of your changes, click "+" to enable syncing, click "Commit & Sync".

## Merge your branch back into "develop" and delete your branch

Follow this section when you are finished editing your version of the code and are ready to merge your changes back into "develop".

- Make "develop" your active branch.
- Click "Sync Branch" in case someone else commited to "develop" while you were editing your verison.
- Merge your changes into "develop": Click "Branches" > click "Merge View" > drag your branch into the left-hand box (the branch you're merging from), drag develop into the right-hand box (the branch you're merging into). The display will show "your_branch" => "develop" > click "Merge Branches". Make "develop" your active branch and resolve any conflicts in your text editer.

**Note:** Clicking "Merge Branches" does not sync the merged "develop" branch back to GitHub.

- After resolving any code conflicts, make "develop" your active branch, click "Changes", click "Commit & Sync" (and/or "Sync" if there are unsynced commits).
- All of your code changes in your branch have now been merged into "develop". Delete your branch now that your miniproject is complete. Make "develop" your active branch. Click the down-arrow on your branch, click "Delete", confirm that you want to delete your branch.

**Warning:** Never delete "develop" or "master" branches.

## Merge create a release branch from "develop" and merge into "master"

Follow these instructions to issue a new code release into production. Use semantic versioning from http://semver.org/

- Create a new release branch from develop, e.g. "release_v1.0.0"
- Test the release branch.
- Issue a pull request to merge from the release branch into master:
  - Navigate to https://github.com/ccd-utexas/tsphot
  - Make "master" the active branch.
  - By "release_v1.0.0", click "Compare and pull request" > click "Edit".
  - Set:
	
    base: master
	
    compare: release_v1.0.0
	
  - This will merge release_v1.0.0 into master
  - Click "Send pull request"
  - A ccd-utexas owner will review the changes and click "Confirm". After the pull request is confirmed, your branch "release_v1.0.0" on GitHub will be deleted. Withing the GitHub application, "release_v1.0.0" will become unpublished. Delete "release_v1.0.0" within the GitHub application.
- Admin: 
  - Once the pull request has been merged, delete the branch "release_v1.0.0" on GitHub.
  - Tag the release with the version number at https://github.com/ccd-utexas/tsphot/releases

## Admin: Make a backup of tsphot
- Fork tsphot from your own GitHub account and rename to tsphot_BACKUP.
- Update your backup by clicking "Compare, review, create a pull request" (circular branch symbol)
- Click "Edit"
- Set:
  
  base fork: your_account/tsphot_BACKUP compare: master

  head fork: ccd-utexas/tsphot base: master

- This will merge ccd-utexas/tsphot:master into your_account/tsphot_BACKUP:master
- Complete the pull request and merge.
